	abstract = {Due to its unique structure, recent years have witnessed the use of apo-ferritin to accumulate various non-natural metal ions as a scaffold for nanomaterial synthesis. However, the transport mechanism of metal ions into the cavity of apo-ferritin is still unclear, limiting the rational design and controllable preparation of nanomaterials. Here, we conducted all-atom classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with Markov state models (MSMs) to explore the transportation behavior of Au(III) ions. We exhibited the complete transportation paths of Au(III) from solution into the apo-ferritin cage at the atomic level. We also revealed that the transportation of Au(III) ions is accompanied by coupled protein structural changes. It is shown that the 3-fold axis channel serves as the only entrance with the longest residence time of Au(III) ions. Besides, there are eight binding clusters and five 3-fold structural metastable states, which are important during Au(III) transportation. The conformational changes of His118, Asp127, and Glu130, acting as doors, were observed to highly correlate with the Au(III) ion's position. The MSM analysis and Potential Mean Force (PMF) calculation suggest a remarkable energy barrier near Glu130, making it the rate-limiting step of the whole process. The dominant transportation pathway is from cluster 3 in the 3-fold channel to the inner cavity to cluster 5 on the inner surface, and then to cluster 6. These findings provide inspiration and theoretical guidance for the further rational design and preparation of new nanomaterials using apo-ferritin.},

Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) is extensively used for producing various chemicals because of its rich catalytic mechanisms, broad substrate spectrum, thermal stability, and tolerance to organic solvents. In this study, an all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) combined with Markov-state models (MSMs) implemented in pyEMMA was proposed to simulate diffusion pathways of 4-nitrophenyl ester (4NPE), a commonly used substrate, from the surface into the active site of CALB. Six important metastable conformations of CALB were identified in the diffusion process, including a closed state. An induced-fit mechanism incorporating multiple pathways with molecular information was proposed, which might find unprecedented applications for the rational design of lipase for green catalysis.},

            Modulating the distribution of various states in protein ensembles through distal sites may be promising in the evolution of enzymes in desired directions. However, the prediction of distal mutation hotspots that stabilize the favoured states from a computational perspective remains challenging. Here, we presented a strategy based on molecular dynamics (MD) and Markov state models (MSM) to predict distal mutation sites. Extensive MD combined with MSM was applied to determine the principally distributed metastable states interconverting at a slow timescale. Then, molecular docking was used to classify these states into active states and inactive ones. Distal mutation hotspots were targeted based on comparing the conformational features between active and inactive states, where mutations destabilize the inactive states and show little influence on the active state. The proposed strategy was used to explore the highly dynamic MHETase, which shows a potential application in the biodegradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). Seven principally populated interrelated metastable states were identified, and the atomistic picture of their conformational changes was unveiled. Several residues at distal positions were found to adopt more H-bond occupancies in inactive states than active states, making them potential mutation hotspots for stabilizing the favoured conformations. In addition, the detailed mechanism revealed the significance of calcium ions at a distance from the catalytic centre in reshaping the free energy landscape. This study deepens the understanding of the conformational dynamics of α/β hydrolases containing a lid domain and advances the study of enzymatic plastic degradation.},

However, design and precise regulation of their structure at an atomic level remain challenging. Herein, we have engineered and constructed a gold clustering site at the 4-fold symmetric axis channel of the apo-ferritin cage. Using a series of X-ray crystal structures, we evaluated the stepwise accumulation process of Au ions into the cage and the formation of a multinuclear Au cluster in our designed cavity. We also disclosed the role of key residues in the metal accumulation process. X-ray crystal structures in combination with quantum chemical (QC) calculation revealed a unique Au clustering site with up to 12 Au atoms positions in the cavity. Moreover, the structure of the gold nanocluster was precisely tuned by the dosage of the Au precursor. As the gold concentration increases, the number of Au atoms position at the clustering site increases from 8 to 12, and a structural rearrangement was observed at a higher Au concentration. Furthermore, the binding affinity order of the four Au binding sites on apo-ferritin was unveiled with a stepwise increase of Au precursor concentration.},

In this study, we described the design and synthesis of an artificial metalloenzyme, a cycloisomerase that utilizes Au(I) incorporated into an apo-ferritin cage (Fr−Au) to efficiently catalyze the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids, with a conversion of 83\% and a turnover frequency of 20.6 × 103· h−1 in aqueous solution under mild conditions. The remarkable catalytic activity indicates that the nano-confinement of the Au(I) active site within the ferritin cage enhances its catalytic properties by stabilizing and solubilizing it. The less protected Au atom in the cysteine bridged dinuclear Au(I) active center was identified as critical for the Fr−Au cycloisomerases to catalyze this reaction. In addition, we provide insight into the catalytic mechanism through quantum chemical (QC) calculations, which reveal an energy barrier of 32.29 kJ/mol.},

In this study, we discovered and engineered a novel DAE Rum55, derived from a human gut bacterium Ruminococcus sp. CAG55. The activity of Rum55 was strictly dependent on the presence of Co2+, and it exhibited an equilibrium conversion rate of 30.6 \% and a half-life of 4.5 h at 50 ◦C. To enhance its performance, we engineered the interface interaction of Rum55 to stabilize its tetramer structure, and the best variant E268R was then attached with a self-assembling peptide to form active enzyme aggregates as carrier-free immobilization. The half-life of the best variant E268R-EKL16 at 50 ◦C was dramatically increased 30-fold to 135.3 h, and it maintained 90 \% of its activity after 13 consecutive reaction cycles. Additionally, we identified that metal ions played a key role in stabilizing the tetramer structure of Rum55, and the dependence on metal ions for E268R-EKL16 was significantly reduced. This study provides a useful route for improving the thermostability of DAEs, opening up new possibilities for the industrial production of D-allulose.},

	abstract = {Many protein sequences occupy similar three-dimensional structures known as protein folds. In nature, protein folds are well-conserved over the course of evolution, such that there are 100,000 times as many extant protein sequences than there are folds. Despite their common shapes, similar protein folds can adopt wide-ranging functions, raising the question: are protein folds so strongly conserved for the purpose of maintaining function-driving energetic changes in protein families? Here we show that a set of key energetic relationships in a family of bacterial transcription factors (TFs) is conserved using high-resolution hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations. We compared the TFs to their anciently diverged structural homologs, the periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs), expecting that protein families that share the same fold and bind the same sugars would have similar energetic responses. Surprisingly, our findings reveal the opposite: the "energetic blueprints" of the PBPs and the TFs are largely distinct, with the allosteric network of the TFs evolving specifically to support the functional requirements of genome regulation, versus conserved interactions with membrane transport machinery in PBPs. These results demonstrate how the same fold can be adapted for different sense/response functions via family-specific energetic requirements - even when responding to the same chemical trigger. Understanding the evolutionarily conserved energetic blueprint for a protein family provides a roadmap for designing functional proteins de novo, and will help us treat aberrant protein behavior in conserved domains in disease-related drug targets, where engineering selectivity is challenging.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
