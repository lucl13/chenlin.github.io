I grew up in a small town called [Xihai](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Xihaizhen,+Haiyan+County,+Qinghai,+Haibei,+Qinghai,+China,+810299/@33.0747586,81.9877127,4z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x364d5cb1c9e60669:0x4d7557eefa77e26a!8m2!3d36.957868!4d100.902973!16s%2Fg%2F1pv0kg7w?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQxNi4xIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDU1SAFQAw%3D%3D) in China, where I spent a joyful childhood immersed in nature. I completed both my undergraduate and graduate studies at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I became fascinated by the dynamic behavior of proteins—the remarkable molecular machines that sustain life. During my Ph.D., I spent a year in Tokyo as a visiting student, where I solved my first protein structures ([7VIU](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7VIU)) and enjoyed the city’s vibrant mix of science and culture.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Glasgow Lab](https://glasgowlab.org) at Columbia University, continuing my journey to explore protein dynamics and conformational landscapes. My research lies at the intersection of computational and experimental biophysics, combined with machine learning, to understand allosteric regulation and to advance the de novo design of allosteric proteins.

I'm developing methods to push the limits of HX/MS, enabling residue-level resolution of protein dynamics and uncovering allosteric regulation hidden from traditional structural techniques. These insights are guiding my long-term goal: designing allosteric proteins with controllable functions.
